-- In this folder there are several binary SVM predictors that were each 
   trained using different features. The following is a brief description 
   of each predictor which includes the feature extractor that it needs to
   be used with. If a predictor is used with the wrong number of features
   then an assertion is thrown, however if a predictor is used with the 
   same number but wrong features then results will be unpredictable. It is
   thus important to map the predictors to their appropriate feature extractors.
   Also shown is the best performance of the predictor under 10-fold cross
   validation for the dataset on which it was trained. The predictors are 
   grouped into directories based on which dataset was used to train them.
   Thus for instance, predictors trained on the AdvCalc1 dataset are placed 
   in the AdvCalc1/ directory.

-- The convention for naming a predictor is as follows:
[classifier name]_[feature extractor name]

Radial Basis Function (RBF) SVM predictors:
Each predictor uses the feature extractor whose name matches the F_Ext part 
of the predictor name. See FeatureVectorFormats which is 2 directories up from 
this one for the list of features used in each extractor.
