This is the dlib machine learning library used for this project
Visit http://dlib.net for more info. The examples are included here
but don't compile with the project by default since they take 
FOREVER.

If you want to compile the examples go into the dlib/ directory
and run sudo make install then go to the examples/
directory run autogen.sh, ./configure, and make. Then you may need 
to run the command 'sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib' because all the libraries
the examples use are there. Finally, go to the examples directory and run
tar -xzvf dlib.tar.gz. That has all the headers in it which the examples
require. I had to compress it because the file names end up being too
long for the git repo otherwise.
