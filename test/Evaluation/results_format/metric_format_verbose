Verbose metric files give pixel accurate metrics on each individual region:
[Box #] [Set #] // box is the region #, set is either 0 or 1 (0 for hypothesis, 1 for groundtruth)
  // region dimensions
  [Box area]
  [Box width]
  [Box height]
  // overlapping groundtruth boxes to this hypothesis box
  [# overlapping groundtruth boxes]
  // pixel counts
  [# total foreground pix (tp+fp+tn+fn)]
  [# total positively detected pix (tp+fp)]
  [# total true positive pix (tp)]
  [# total false negative pix (fn)]
  [# total false positive pix (fp)]
  // metrics based on the pixel counts
  [TPR/Recall/Sensitivity/Hit_Rate = tp/(tp+fn)]
  [Precision/Positive_Predictive_Value = tp/(tp+fp)]
  [FPR/Fallout = fp/(fp+tn)]
  [False_Discovery_Rate = fp/(fp+tp)]
