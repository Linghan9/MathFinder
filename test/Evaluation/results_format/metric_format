This is how a normal, non-verbose metric file is formated:
// region-wide statistics:
[# correctly segemented regions] / [total # regions]
[# regions completely missed (fn)]
[# regions completely wrongly detected (fp)]

// stats on oversegmentations and undersegmentations:
[# oversegmented regions]
[# total oversegmentations for all regions]
[# avg oversegmentations per oversegmented groundtruth region]
[# undersegmented regions]
[# total undersegmentations for all regions]
[# avg undersegmentations for undersegmented hypothesis region]

// pixel counts:
[# total foreground pix (tp+fp+tn+fn)]
[# total positively detected pix (tp+fp)]
[# total negatively detected pix (tn+fn)]
[# total true positive pix (tp)]
[# total false negative pix (fn)]
[# total true negative pix (tn)]
[# total false positive pix (fp)]

// metrics based on pixel counts (all between 0 and 1)
[TPR/Recall/Sensitivity/Hit_Rate = tp/(tp+fn)]
[Precision/Positive_Predictive_Value = tp/(tp+fp)]
[Accuracy = (tp+tn)/(tp+fn+tn+fp)]
[FPR/Fallout = fp/(fp+tn)]
[False_Discovery_Rate = fp/(fp+tp)]
[TNR/Specificity = tn/(fp+tn)]
[Negative_Predictive_Value = tn/(tn+fn)]
