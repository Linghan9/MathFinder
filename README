This project requires Qt, Leptonica (http://www.leptonica.com/), and libpng-dev to be pre-installed and on the system path.

To compile this project, run the following commands from this directory:

autoreconf -vfi
./configure
make
sudo make install

You'll have to also set the TESSDATA_PREFIX enviornment variable to /usr/local/share (the install script unpacks it there). 
To do so, run the following:

export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/local/share

And then add the above line to your ~.bashrc file to persist the change.

MathFinder [path to directory or image on which to run]


To run the project for training, evaluation, or to print information, run with interactive menu as follows:
