This project requires Qt, libpng-dev, libjpeg-dev, and Leptonica 
(http://www.leptonica.com/) to be pre-installed and on the system path. Need 
to install the png and jpeg libraries before Leptonica for it to be able to 
read/write png and jpeg images. It optionally requires Java for some of the 
debugging features work. 

This project can be compiled and installed by running the following commands 
from this directory:

autoreconf -vfi
./configure
make
sudo make install

----------------------------------------------------------------

The TESSDATA_PREFIX and SCROLLVIEW_PATH environment variables also need to be 
set in order to run Tesseract and view results respectively. This is because 
Tesseract only looks on those specific paths and won't look on the system 
path. This can be done by running the following commands:

export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/local/share
export SCROLLVIEW_PATH=/usr/local/share/scrollview

And then copying and pasting the above lines to the ~/.bashrc file to persist 
the changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following commands will run the application:

MathFinder [path to directory or image on which to run]


To run the project for training, evaluation, or to print information, run with
interactive menu as follows:

MathFinder -m
