Here is a description of all of the tools developed to generate data. These all require ImageMagick in order to work properly.

convert_pdfpages 
- Script to convert a multi-page pdf document into individual png images with up to 
  600 dpi resolution (may be lower depending on the resolution within the pdf document).   

select_random
- Randomly selects a desired number of .png images from a set generated by convert_pdfpages. 
  If the desired number is greater than the number of images in the set, then the number
  in the set is simply returned. As the number of desired random images approaches the 
  number in the set, the degree of randomness decreases

remove_alpha
- Sometimes the images may have an alpha rather than white background. Given the output
  of select_random and the name of the pdf (without extension) from which the png's
  where generated, this script will replace alpha background with white background
  for desired images.

rename_pngs
- Renames all of the .png files selected by the select_random script so that they are 
  simply named by their index number (ie 000.png,001.png,etc). Also runs ImageMagick's
  "identify" program on each png to append verbose info on each image to a file which
  is also placed in the directory with the renamed files.

writefilenames
- Run after rename_pngs to write the original pdf name and page number corresponding to
  each image to a text file also in the directory where rename_pngs placed the renamed
  images.

select_training
- Randomly selects a desired subset of the images from select_random assuming they 
  have already been renamed by rename_pngs and placed in a separate directory.
  Places these randomly selected training images in a chosen directory

MathFinderGtGen
- GUI developed in Qt, which allows user to manually label the bounding boxes of 
  expression regions in images, and have the labels automatically appended to 
  a file. Originally from OSR project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/osr/.
